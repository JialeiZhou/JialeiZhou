# Personal Project Repository

This repository serves as a centralized collection of my academic, technical, and exploratory projects throughout my undergraduate studies in **Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE)**.

## About Me
I am an ECE undergraduate student with interests spanning **computer systems, embedded systems, and applied engineering**. This repository reflects my continuous skill development, problem-solving approach, and technical growth.

## Repository Scope
Projects stored here may include (but are not limited to): 
- Independent technical projects and experiments  
- Research-oriented explorations and prototypes  
- Programming practice and system-level implementations  

Each project is documented with a focus on **clarity, reproducibility, and engineering rationale**, rather than results alone.

## Purpose
This repository is intended to:
- Track my long-term technical progression  
- Demonstrate hands-on engineering capability
- Serve as a transparent portfolio for academic and professional evaluation  

Content will be updated iteratively as my coursework, research exposure, and project complexity evolve.
